Functionality
- Voice story URLs
- Better error handling
  -> Including a separate error_message file?
- Shorten emails (& pattern match to distinguish?)
  -> mail urls like mailto:dumbass@maxbernste.in are prepended with http :(
- Create overwrite code
- Stats page
  -> Use API to generate graphs or frequency or whatever
- About page
  -> Have accepted formats. Perhaps have this on front page??

API


Design
- Kill button gradient
- Custom URL text box should be on same line as "http://"
- "Powered by The Paly Voice" should be a sticker
- Short URL should be more easily selectable

Meta
- Make README better
- Automated testing (continual!)
